Protect the Island is an arcade-style game where the player needs to protect the island from an asteroid attack.

When an asteroid lands on an island, it starts a fire. To put out the fire, the player must fire an arrow at a floating bucket of water. If the player misses a bucket they lose a life. The rate of asteroids falling increases as the game goes on.
